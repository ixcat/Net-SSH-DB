SSH Processing
==============

code review:
  - existing event interpretation logic appears mostly functional, 
    but has some problems/possible problems:

    - pid is main event key - which could cause problems for multi-host logs
    - data should be reviewed for accuracy: tracked in 'fixme' dir

code improvement:

  - break out log-event generator from log-event interpreter
    - this allows the 'raw dump' (sftpdmp) to proceed without date 
      interpretation or with optional date interpretation
    - then, processing can be made to actually perform date interpretation
  - break out the syslog date interpretation logic into a separate class
    which is then used by the log-event interpreter.



errata/bugs:
  - no reliable way to track system restarts
    - sshd itself doesn't terminate all connections on restart,
      sshd restart is not tied to host restart
  - so, this must be interpolated externally e.g. via utmp reboot
    records.

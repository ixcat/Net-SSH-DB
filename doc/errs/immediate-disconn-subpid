pid guessing heuristics only work for sftp at present,
and so don't catch e.g:

Apr 30 13:35:19 eve sshd[10238]: Accepted password for dd4932 from 173.198.127.66 port 42908 ssh2
Apr 30 13:35:21 eve sshd[10240]: Received disconnect from 173.198.127.66: 11: disconnected by user

some ides:

  - track rhost:pids
  - on disconnect, snag 'best match' of rhost:pids
    - only guaranteed match in 'one pid' case
    - secondary guesses:

      - proximate pid number (assuming ascending PID's, 
        which is not case for OB) -
        ob would have to reconstruct pid sequence from first-seen pid in log
        which is getting a bit contrived / extra work
        (tracking pid sequence to track proximate pid)

    - post-facto cleaning:
      - cross-correlation from user login data
      - cross-correlation from process accounting

this is small number of logins for now - .6% for 6mo data across (3/453 logins)

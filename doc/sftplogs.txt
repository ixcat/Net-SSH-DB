ssh/sftp log snippets for parse testing..

basically, due to privsep and incomplete logging, logic to properly
track/parse sftp requires subprocess tracing to capture sftp for 
non-root users..

could probably disable privsep to stop this.. but seems like bad idea

short answer: 

setting logging to 'verbose' (instead of 'info') generates subprocess
message, which then can be used to look match sftp subsystem requests
back to the encompassing 'session' PID


-- examples: --

# root ssh

works - all ssh processes handle from same toplevel

sshd[1122]: Accepted publickey for root from 192.168.1.21 port 34264 ssh2
sshd[1122]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)
sshd[1122]: Received disconnect from 192.168.1.21: 11: disconnected by user
sshd[1122]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user root

# root sftp

works - sftp request occurs from same non-privsep process

sshd[1230]: Accepted publickey for root from 192.168.1.21 port 10478 ssh2
sshd[1230]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user root by (uid=0)

sshd[1230]: Received disconnect from 192.168.1.21: 11: disconnected by user
sshd[1230]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user root

# non-root ssh

works - pam logmsg can be pid-matched and correlates to ssh logout

sshd[812]: Accepted publickey for chris from 192.168.1.21 port 34159 ssh2
sshd[812]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user chris by (uid=0)
sshd[817]: Received disconnect from 192.168.1.21: 11: disconnected by user
sshd[812]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session closed for user chris

# non-root sftp

doesn't work: no definite connection from top level proc to sftp logmsg
  .. could more-than-likely be guessed by correlating pam logout to pid,
     and reprocessing that pid's messages against pam logout pid, 
     or similar .. but that's alot of logic, and still error prone..

so there is no easy way to tie logout to login, by default..
setting to 'LogLevel VERBOSE' logging allows tracking via child PID handoff..:
